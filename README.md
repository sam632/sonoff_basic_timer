# sonoff_basic_timer
Uses @ajithvasudevan code as a basis but is for a single relay, namely a Sonoff Basic along with a DS321 RTC and a SSD1306 screen. 
It uses the 3.3V, GND, RX, TX pins to interface with DS321 and SSD1306. 
Connect to the device via wifi on a smartphone and type http://192.168.4.1/ in safari to set the on and off times.
Can also control the state and mode of the relay using two buttons connected to IO2 and the orginal button on GPIO0 of the sonoff.
